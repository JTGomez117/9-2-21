<p>Above this paragraph is three of my favorite games/series. Below this paragraph are my top 3 call of dutys in order from least to greatest.</p>
<h3>Top 3 Favorite COD's</h3>

<ol>
<li>Call of Duty Black Ops 3</li>
<li>Call of Duty Black Ops 2</li>
<li>Call of Duty Modern Warfare</li>
<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>Although most people like COD BO2 more than COD BO3 I like BO3 more because I spent a lot more time in that game and the zombies was amazing. Also in BO2 zombies you die in 2 hits so it is much harder and less fun in my opinion. Between Modern Warfare and Cold War I have to say MW is better.</p>
<p>Below is a link that redirects you to amazon where you can buy BO3</p>
